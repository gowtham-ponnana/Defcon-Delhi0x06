# Defcon-Delhi0x06

On Dec 16th, 2023 I've given a talk on the topic of "How to Get into Web3 Sec: A Web2 Security Researcher's perspective" which inreturn got amazing response. As promised, here are the all the sides and resources that I've mentioned in the talk. 


## Note
- I've used "Remix - An Ethereum IDE" for demonstration purpose as it is simple to use and deploy contracts. If you want to learn in depth, I recommend you to start learning "Foundry - Development Framework for solidity and EVM based" as you'll understand how it works.
